ðŸ‘€I'm @Retx3D
I'm a robotics and .NET enthusiast. 

I enjoy playing with CAD, Software & Electronics.

âš¡ My projects of the moment:

    ðŸŒ±Making a Scara Robot that is easy to build with a majority of 3D printing parts. If it works, my goal is to make it an open source to be used for a lot of purposes: 
        * Cheap robot to build for educational purposes
        * The fun of having a robotic arm at home to work on Direct & Indirect kinematics model
        * Cheap pick & place robot
        * A veeeeery cool 3DPrinter/reprap

    ðŸŒ±Others to be disclosed later on
